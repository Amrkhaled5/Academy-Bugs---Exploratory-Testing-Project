# 🐛 Academy Bugs - Exploratory Testing Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository documents a comprehensive exploratory testing exercise conducted on [Academy Bugs](https://academybugs.com/find-bugs/), a deliberately buggy e-commerce application designed for testing practice.

**Challenge Completed:** Found **25 critical bugs** in **2 hours** of intensive exploratory testing.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform thorough exploratory testing on a complex e-commerce application
- Identify and document various types of bugs (UI, functional, usability, performance)
- Practice real-world testing scenarios without predefined test cases
- Demonstrate systematic bug hunting and documentation skills

## 🛠️ Testing Approach

### Methodology
- **Exploratory Testing**: Simultaneous test design and execution
- **Session-Based Testing**: Focused 2-hour testing session
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritized critical user journeys

### Areas Tested
- User Registration & Authentication
- Product Catalog & Search
- Shopping Cart Functionality
- Checkout Process
- Payment Processing
- User Profile Management
- Navigation & UI Elements
- Form Validations
- Error Handling

## 🐞 Bug Summary

| Severity | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 8 | Prevents core functionality, blocks user journeys |
| **High** | 10 | Significant impact on user experience |
| **Medium** | 5 | Minor issues that affect usability |
| **Low** | 2 | Cosmetic issues with minimal impact |

### Bug Categories
- 🔐 **Authentication Issues** (5 bugs)
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart Problems** (7 bugs)
- 💳 **Payment & Checkout Errors** (6 bugs)
- 🎨 **UI/Visual Bugs** (4 bugs)
- 🔍 **Search & Filter Issues** (3 bugs)

### Reproducing the Bugs
1. Visit [Academy Bugs Website](https://academybugs.com/find-bugs/)
2. Navigate to the specific bug reports in the `bug-reports/` folder
3. Follow the reproduction steps outlined in each bug report
4. Compare your results with the provided screenshots

## 📊 Key Findings

### Most Critical Issues
1. **Payment Processing Failure** - Users can complete checkout without payment
2. **Cart Persistence Bug** - Items disappear randomly from cart
3. **Authentication Bypass** - Direct URL access bypasses login requirements

### Impact Assessment
- **User Journey Completion Rate**: 32% (8/25 critical paths failed)
- **Data Integrity Issues**: 6 bugs affecting data consistency
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 3 potential security risks identified

## 📈 Testing Metrics

- **Total Testing Time**: 2 hours
- **Bugs Found**: 25
- **Bug Discovery Rate**: 12.5 bugs/hour
- **Coverage Areas**: 9 major functional areas
